# Changelog

## v0.1.0 — Public MVP Release

**Date:** 2026-07-01

**Live demo:** https://budget-engineer.vercel.app/
**Repository:** https://github.com/securequalitybuilders-art/budget-engineer

### Core Pipeline
- AI brief parser (deterministic, regex-based, Zod-validated)
- AI design engine — generates 3 design options (compact/standard/spacious)
- 6-stage pipeline UI: Brief → Concept → Design → Engineering → Docs → Cost
- First-time builder journey with template briefs and guided steps

### CAD / BIM
- 2D plan canvas with pan/zoom, wall drawing, room labels, dimensions
- Multi-floor support
- Wall corner solver (intersection trim)
- DXF/SVG/MakerJS export
- 3D BIM viewer (React Three Fiber) with legend, inspector, floor visibility
- 2D/3D toggle in Dashboard toolbar

### Engineering Analysis
- 3-rule BIM clash detection (opening proximity, overlap, AABB collision)
- Cardinal solar orientation heat gain analysis (N/E/S/W walls + windows)
- MEP services takeoff (electrical, lighting, plumbing points per zone)

### BOQ / Export
- Geometry-derived BOQ quantities (door/window/partition/finish from actual CAD geometry)
- Regional rate card pricing (Zimbabwe, South Africa, Kenya, Global)
- CSV export, HTML dossier, print-to-PDF
- Regional currency support (USD, ZWG)
- Rate assumptions displayed in export

### Persistence & Versioning
- IndexedDB persistence via Dexie (10 tables)
- Project data survives page refresh
- Design snapshot save/load/compare with cost and quantity deltas
- Transaction logging on all mutations
- Governance audit trail (approval readiness checklist, RBAC roles, design fingerprint)

### Portfolio & Governance
- Portfolio Dashboard at `/portfolio` with executive summary stats
- Category distribution breakdown (Walls/Slabs/Roof/Openings/Objects)
- Project search, status filter (All/Active/Archived), sort (newest/name/cost)
- Archive/restore actions on project cards
- Governance/audit panel with approval checklist and RBAC role descriptions

### Testing & CI
- 117 automated tests across 12 files (vitest + fake-indexeddb)
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline: typecheck → lint → test → build
- Test coverage across all core adapters: governance, geometry, BOQ, BIM, analysis, rate cards, persistence, snapshots, archive, portfolio filters

### Known Limitations
- Cost rates are approximate and vary by region — not suitable for procurement
- No professional structural engineer sign-off — designs are for concept/feasibility only
- Generated CAD is deterministic and early-stage — manual editing recommended
- WebLLM parser is opt-in (`@mlc-ai/web-llm` not pre-installed)
- Not a replacement for professional quantity surveyor or engineering review
- Multi-floor uses same room template for all levels
- Finishes and services are percentage-based estimates
- Mobile review supported; CAD editing best on tablet/desktop
- No cloud sync or multi-user support
