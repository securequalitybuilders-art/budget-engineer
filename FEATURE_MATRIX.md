# Feature Matrix — Budget Engineer Premium Architectural Studio

> **Date:** 2026-07-11 (v1.0.0)  
> **Status:** Current capability matrix for the Premium Architectural Studio release.  
> **Legend:** ✅ Present | ❌ Missing | 🔄 Staged (not wired)  
> **Release baseline:** 1,059 tests across 61 test files, strict TypeScript green, build green, lint within warning budget.  
> **Architecture baseline:** Local-first, offline-capable, zero paid APIs, no backend, no cloud LLM.  
> **Note:** Historical merge/audit detail below is retained for reference where still useful, but the current release truth is **v1.0.0 Premium Architectural Studio**.

## Interpretation Notes

- **✅ Present** means implemented and available in the current release.
- **🔄 Staged** means present in code or architecture but not yet fully surfaced in user workflow.
- **❌ Missing** means not implemented in the current release.
- Where older WS1/WS2/WS3 merge notes remain below, they should be read as **historical implementation lineage**, not as the current release headline.
