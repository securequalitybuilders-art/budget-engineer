## Commercial Positioning

### What It Is

> **A professional-grade, local-first architecture, engineering, and construction lifecycle platform with human review in the loop.**

Budget Engineer supports professionals across the full project lifecycle — from brief and concept through design, engineering, documentation, BOQ/cost, procurement, delivery, and handover — while keeping all data local, all processing offline, and all decisions under human professional control.

### Who It Is For

- Architects and architectural technologists
- Engineers (structural, MEP) in early-stage pre-design
- Quantity surveyors and cost consultants
- Contractors preparing preconstruction packages
- Developers evaluating project feasibility
- Students learning the design-to-construction pipeline
- Organizations evaluating or piloting the platform

### What Requires Human Review

Budget Engineer is an assistive professional tool, not an automated replacement for licensed professionals. Every capability group that produces decision-grade output is clearly flagged with human review requirements. See the in-app **Product Package** panel for the complete capability manifest with review annotations.

### What It Does Not Claim

Budget Engineer does **not** position itself as:
- A full licensed architect replacement
- Final structural engineering signoff software
- Automatic certified building code approval
- A native proprietary CAD/BIM suite replacement (DWG, RVT)
- A fully cloud-native, multi-tenant collaboration platform
- A construction management, ERP, or accounting system

The platform is designed to **compress professional workflow time while keeping human expertise and signoff firmly in the loop**.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start the dev server (Vite HMR) |
| `npm run build` | TypeScript check + production build + PWA generation |
| `npm run build:only` | Production build without typecheck (for CI) |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build locally |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript strict check (`tsc --noEmit`) |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint with max 25 warnings |
| `npm test` | Run fast-path unit/component tests (single thread) |
| `npm run test:watch` | Tests in watch mode |
| `npm run test:fast` | Alias for `npm test` (fast-path only) |
| `npm run test:shard1` | Fast-path shard 1/3 (for CI parallel execution) |
| `npm run test:shard2` | Fast-path shard 2/3 |
| `npm run test:shard3` | Fast-path shard 3/3 |
| `npm run test:integration` | Run heavy three.js / page-mount integration tests |
| `npm run test:ci` | CI simulation: typecheck + 3 shards + integration (sequential) |
| `npm run test:release` | Full release gate: typecheck → build → fast tests → integration |
| `npm run lighthouse` | Build + Lighthouse CI audit |

## Validation Lanes

Tests are organized into explicit lanes for clear CI and local verification:

| Lane | Coverage | Wall Time | When to Run |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **typecheck** | `tsc --noEmit` — 0 errors | ~20s | Always before commit |
| **fast shard 1** | ~45 test files (unit + component) | ~2-3 min | CI parallel runner 1 |
| **fast shard 2** | ~45 test files (unit + component) | ~2-3 min | CI parallel runner 2 |
| **fast shard 3** | ~46 test files (unit + component) | ~2-3 min | CI parallel runner 3 |
| **integration** | 2 files, 7 heavy page-mount tests | ~15s | CI parallel runner 4; before merging |
| **build** | `vite build` | ~2-3 min | CI after typecheck passes |

**Sharding**: Vitest `--shard` splits test files deterministically by path. Each shard pays its own module-loading cost. In CI, all 3 fast shards + integration run in parallel, reducing wall time from ~8 min to ~3 min. Locally, `npm test` runs all fast-path files in a single thread (simplest).

## CI Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push to `main` and every pull request targeting `main`. It also runs on version tags (`v*`) for release verification.

### Job structure

```
push / pull_request
        │
   ┌────┴────┐
   │ typecheck│  ← Gate 1 (fail-fast)
   └────┬────┘
        │
   ┌────┼────┬────┬────┬────┐
   │    │    │    │    │    │
   ▼    ▼    ▼    ▼    ▼    ▼
 lint shard-1 shard-2 shard-3 integration build
   │    │     │      │      │         │
   └────┴─────┴──────┴──────┴─────────┘
                  │
                  ▼
           release-gate  ← Aggregate check for branch protection
```

### Commands → Jobs

| Job | Script | Purpose |
|-----|--------|---------|
| `typecheck` | `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript strict check — 0 errors required |
| `lint` | `npm run lint` | ESLint — max 25 warnings |
| `shard-1` | `npm run test:shard1` | Fast-path tests shard 1/3 |
| `shard-2` | `npm run test:shard2` | Fast-path tests shard 2/3 |
| `shard-3` | `npm run test:shard3` | Fast-path tests shard 3/3 |
| `integration` | `npm run test:integration` | Heavy three.js / page-mount tests |
| `build` | `npm run build:only` | Production build (typecheck already passed) |
| `release-gate` | (aggregate check) | Passes only if all above lanes pass |

### Release gate definition

A **release** is any tag matching `v*` pushed to the repository. The workflow runs the same set of lanes for both PRs and tags. The `release-gate` job aggregates results from all parallel lanes and:

- **Passes** — every lane succeeded → the commit is fit for release
- **Fails** — one or more lanes failed → the release must not proceed

There is no separate "light" release path. Every release must pass typecheck, lint, all test shards, integration tests, and a production build.

---

## Quality

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Tests | 1,500+ across 136 fast-path + 2 integration test files |
| TypeScript | 0 errors (strict mode) |
| Lighthouse A11y | 100 |
| Lighthouse Best Practices | 100 |
| Lighthouse SEO | 100 |
| Lighthouse Performance | 74–76 (varies by machine) |

---

## Export Formats

| Format | Use Case |
|---|---|
| **DXF** | CAD interoperability (AIA layers, dimensions, blocks, paper space) |
| **PDF** | BOQ dossier, presentation sheets, board export, drawings (print-to-PDF) |
| **CSV** | BOQ spreadsheet with regional pricing and rate metadata |
| **HTML** | Self-contained BOQ dossier (opens in any browser, print-to-PDF) |
| **SVG** | Drawings, sun-path diagrams, shadow overlays, board cells |
| **PNG** | Board export, drawing snapshots |
| **GLB** | 3D model for external viewers |
| **IFC** | IFC4 STEP format for BIM software |
| **ZIP** | Project archive package with manifest |

> **No DWG export.** DWG is a proprietary Autodesk format — it cannot be fully implemented in-browser. For AutoCAD or ArchiCAD workflows, use **DXF** as the interchange format.

---

## Architecture Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Local-first** | All data in IndexedDB. No server, no cloud storage. |
| **Zero paid APIs** | No OpenAI, Anthropic, or Gemini API calls — ever. |
| **Fully offline** | PWA with service worker. Works without network after first load. |
| **Privacy by architecture** | No telemetry, no analytics, no data collection, no data leaves the device. |
| **Modular** | Domain models → stores → adapters → components. Clean separation. |
| **Test-first** | Full suite passing. Every feature phase includes dedicated test coverage. |
| **Honest UX** | All limitations documented in-app. No false claims about capabilities. |

---

## Deploy

See [docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for the full deployment lifecycle:
hosting setup, preview vs production, release process, smoke-test checklist, and
rollback guidance.

Quick reference:

| Deploy target | Command / Trigger | Result |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Local dev | `npm run dev` | Vite HMR dev server |
| PR preview | Push to PR branch (Vercel/Netlify auto-deploy) | Preview URL |
| Production | Push to `main` (Vercel/Netlify auto-deploy) | Live URL |
| Production | `npm run build && upload dist/` | Any static host |

SPA fallback is configured via `vercel.json` and `public/_redirects` for Netlify.

---

## CI Pipeline

Two GitHub Actions workflows run in parallel:

**CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) — quality validation on every PR, main push,
and tag push:

```
push / pull_request / tag v*
        │
   ┌────┴────┐
   │ typecheck│  ← Gate 1 (fail-fast)
   └────┬────┘
        │
   ┌────┼────┬────┬────┬────┐
   │    │    │    │    │    │
   ▼    ▼    ▼    ▼    ▼    ▼
 lint shard-1 shard-2 shard-3 integration build
   │    │     │      │      │         │
   └────┴─────┴──────┴──────┴─────────┘
                  │
                  ▼
           release-gate  ← Aggregate check for branch protection
```

| Job | What it runs | Purpose |
|-----|--------------|---------|
| `typecheck` | `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript strict check — 0 errors required |
| `lint` | `npm run lint` | ESLint — max 25 warnings |
| `shard-1/2/3` | `npm run test:shard{1,2,3}` | Fast-path tests split into 3 parallel shards |
| `integration` | `npm run test:integration` | Heavy three.js / page-mount tests |
| `build` | `npm run build:only` | Production build (typecheck already passed in gate) |
| `release-gate` | Aggregate check | Passes only when all 6 lanes pass — single check for branch protection |

**Deploy** (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) — build artifact validation,
automated smoke verification, and deployment signal:

| Job | Runs on | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `validate-build` | PRs, main, tags | Builds the app and verifies dist/ artifact structure |
| `smoke-test` | PRs, main, tags | Playwright smoke tests (with URL retry + PREVIEW NOT READY detection) |
| `preview` | PRs only | Reports preview deployment readiness |
| `production-ready` | main only | Confirms build is valid for production deploy |
| `release-ready` | tags only | Provides release checklist for operator sign-off |

Provider configuration is set via workflow `env:` variables:
`PROVIDER`, `PRODUCTION_URL`, `PREVIEW_URL_PATTERN`. Each checks for a
[GitHub repo variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables)
first, then falls back to the default. See
[docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md#environment-configuration)
for the full variable reference and override instructions.

## Known Limitations

**Be honest about what this tool does and doesn't do:**

- **Approximate compliance** — building code checks (ZBC, SANS 10400, Zambia, Botswana) are for early guidance only. **Always verify with a local authority or registered professional.**
- **No .dwg or .rvt import/export** — only DXF for CAD interoperability. Use DXF export from AutoCAD/ArchiCAD.
- **Wall detection is assistive** — detects edges from uploaded images. You must review and correct results in the CAD editor.
- **Door/window detection approximate** — no offline OCR for room labels. Manual naming required.
- **Walkthrough (first-person)** only on **desktop** with mouse + keyboard (pointer-lock required).
- **Same room template per floor** — multi-floor designs use the same layout for all levels.
- **WebLLM opt-in** — `@mlc-ai/web-llm` must be installed separately. The app works fully without it.
- **Cost rates are regional defaults** — not suitable for procurement or tendering.
- **BOQ finishes and services** — percentage-based estimates, not detailed takeoffs.
- **Board export on large sheets** — A1/A0 with many cells may stress weaker devices.
- **No multi-user sync** — single-user, local-first only. No real-time collaboration.
- **Mobile: review yes, edit on larger screens** — dashboard review works on phones; CAD editing best on tablet or desktop.
- **Not a professional replacement** — aids early-stage design and cost estimation but does not replace qualified architects or engineers.
